He seemed impressed by the way you came in.
"Tell us a story
I know you're not boring"
I was afraid that you would not insist.
"You sound so sleepy
just take this, now leave me"
I said please don't slow me down
If I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town...
Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough,
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road,
The wait is over
I'm now taking over,
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough.
Now every time that I look at myself
"I thought I told you
this world is not for you"
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
"you sound so angry
just calm down, you found me"
I said please don't slow me down
If I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town...
Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough,
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road,
The wait is over
I'm now taking over,
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough.
Last night she said,
"Oh, baby, I feel so down.
Oh it turns me off,
When I feel left out."
So I, I turn 'round,
"Oh, baby, don't care no more.
I know this for sure,
I'm walkin' out that door."
Well, I've been in town for just about fifteen minutes now
And baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walkin' for miles
See, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they can't understand
Your grandsons, they won't understand
On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand...
Last night she said,
"Oh, baby, don't feel so down.
Oh, it turns me off,
When I feel left out."
So I, I turn 'round:
"Oh, baby, gonna be alright."
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night, yeah
Oh, people they don't understand
No, girlfriends, they don't understand
In spaceships, they won't understand
And me, I ain't ever gonna understand...
Last night she said,
"Oh, baby, I feel so down.
See, it turns me off,
When I feel left out."
So I, I turn 'round:
"Oh, little girl, I don't care no more.
I know this for sure,
I'm walking out that door," yeah
